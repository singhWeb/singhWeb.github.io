    He was quite curious about how stuff works since his childhood. So, once he stumbelled upon the feild
    of electroincs and communication he felt in love with the hardware and settled down only after creating 
    is own startup in the feild. Though he is jack of many trades like, H/w designing, progarmming, networking,
    software developing, web designing, web developing, app developing, electrical, secrity devices, cooking,
    driving, kite flying etc. etc. but he never consider himself master as he belives in that, "We born, learn
    and then we die".

    Development, H/w Designing, µC Programming, Software Development, IoT, Mechine Learning etc.
